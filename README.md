# Attribution Modeling for ETL

## Overview

**Attribution Modeling for ETL** is a comprehensive project designed to implement and analyze various marketing attribution models. These models help businesses evaluate the performance of different marketing channels in driving customer conversions. The project integrates with ETL processes to facilitate data-driven decision-making for marketing analytics.

---

## Features

- **First-Touch Attribution**: Assigns all credit to the first channel that interacted with the customer.
- **Last-Touch Attribution**: Credits the last channel before the conversion.
- **Linear Attribution**: Distributes credit equally across all touchpoints in the customer journey.
- **U-Shaped Attribution**: Emphasizes the first and last interactions while sharing remaining credit among middle touchpoints.
- **Time Decay Attribution**: Allocates more credit to touchpoints closer in time to the conversion.

## Dataset
